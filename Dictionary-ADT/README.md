    |-List.H is the header file that contains all the functions for List.c
    |-List.cpp is the source file that contains all the code to implements functions
    |-Dictionary.cpp contains the functions needed to run dictionary commands
    |-Dictionary.h is the header file for Dictionary.cpp
    |-DictionaryTest.cpp is the source file that test each function in Dictionary.cpp
    |-Order.cpp is the source file that will read the lines of an input file and insert
    |-these strings as keys into a Dictionary
|-Additional Notes:
    |- Raj, Sebastion and various other TAs/Tutors helped me with the functions that do not have 
    |- pseudocode
    |- Sebastion also combed through and walked me through almost all my functions helping me with runtime
    |- and debugging
